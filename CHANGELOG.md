# @fransvilhelm/feather

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Use svg props as context instead of separate props/style (by
  [@adambrgmn](https://github.com/adambrgmn) in
  [#27](https://github.com/adambrgmn/fransvilhelm-feather/pull/27))

  Previously we separated svg props and svg styles in the context. But that is
  no longer supported. Instead context is formatted as standard svg props.
  Regular props, e.g. `aria-hidden` etc. are applied directly on the context.
  Styles go under `context.styles`.

### Patch Changes

- Apply focusable false as default (by
  [@adambrgmn](https://github.com/adambrgmn) in

  [#27](https://github.com/adambrgmn/fransvilhelm-feather/pull/27))
